Abstract # Accessibility of web content requires semantic information about widgets, structures, and behaviors, in order to allow assistive technologies to convey appropriate information to persons with disabilities. This specification provides an ontology of roles, states, and properties that define accessible user interface elements and can be used to improve the accessibility and interoperability of web content and applications. These semantics are designed to allow an author to properly convey user interface behaviors and structural information to assistive technologies in document-level markup. This document is part of the WAI-ARIA suite described in the WAI-ARIA Overview. Status of this Document # This section describes the status of this document at the time of its publication. Other documents may supersede this document. A list of current W3C publications and the latest revision of this technical report can be found in the W3C technical reports index at http://www.w3.org/TR/. This is the WAI-ARIA 1.0 W3C Recommendation from the Protocols & Formats Working Group of the Web Accessibility Initiative. The Working Group created an implementation report that shows the exit criteria have been met. The Director approved transition to Recommendation after reviewing this report and after Advisory Committee vote which unanimously supported publication. Some editorial changes have been made since the Proposed Recommendation: removing suggestions of "RDF ID reference", changing the spelling of "programming" to "programing", correcting the spelling of "assistive", and updating some references to latest versions. This document has been reviewed by W3C Members, by software developers, and by other W3C groups and interested parties, and is endorsed by the Director as a W3C Recommendation. It is a stable document and may be used as reference material or cited from another document. W3C's role in making the Recommendation is to draw attention to the specification and to promote its widespread deployment. This enhances the functionality and interoperability of the Web.

Comments received on the WAI-ARIA 1.0 Recommendation cannot result in changes to this version of the specification, but may be addressed in errata or future versions of WAI-ARIA. The Working Group may not make formal responses to comments but future work undertaken by the Working Group may address comments received on this document. This document was produced by a group operating under the 5 February 2004 W3C Patent Policy. W3C maintains a public list of any patent disclosures made in connection with the deliverables of the group; that page also includes instructions for disclosing a patent. An individual who has actual knowledge of a patent which the individual believes contains Essential Claim(s) must disclose the information in accordance with section 6 of the W3C Patent Policy. The disclosure obligations of the Participants of this group are described in the charter. Table of Contents # Abstract Status of This Document 1. Introduction 1.1.
